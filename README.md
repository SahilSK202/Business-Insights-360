## Project Overview

AtliQ Hardware (Imaginary company) is a hardware brick & motor, e-commerce company. It is a consumer electronics firm with operations in several countries. Their company is quickly expanding, but they continue to rely on Excel files for data analyses. Excel files are difficult to understand and ineffective in generating insights. In addition, due to a lack of good analytics, the corporation suffered a significant loss in Latin America.

Hence they have decided to implement the data analytics using PowerBi in their company for the first time to surpass their competitors in the market and to make data driven decisions. This project is hoped to give answers to the questions of stakeholder in terms all the aspects like finance, sales, marketing and supply chain.

- Gross Margin and Net Sales are more significant to the sales team than Net Profit since, in most cases, they have little to no control over operating costs.
- Understanding the changes in marketing spend over time and how those changes affect revenue and gross margin is crucial for the marketing team.
- Forecast Accuracy & Risk (Out of Stock or Excess Inventory) and Net Error & Absolute Error are crucial KPIs for the supply chain team.
- One of the most helpful abilities that aids in the creation of insightful visuals is the managing of stakeholder expectations.
